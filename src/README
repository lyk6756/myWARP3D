                        (Updated June 2017)


==========================================================================


1. OVERVIEW

This directory contains all the source code and makefiles for
WARP3D. All source code is in *.f files. Common areas are named
 "common.....". F90 modules are named "mod...".

We support WARP3D on:

    o Windows (64-bit) 
    o Linux 64-bit (tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
    o Max OS 10.11

On these platforms, we use the Intel ifort & MKL compiler suite.
ON Linux we also use the Intel MPI.

See the specific README files for each platform in the top level
directory.

2. MAXIMUM SIZE OF MODELS


June 2017 -> removed fixed upper limit on number of nodes
The single file containing parameter definitions for the maximum size
models analyzed is "param_def". Only this file is changed to increase
or decrease the maximum problem size. Simply set:

 mxel=####

"mxel" to the max number of elements
and run the "Makewarp.bash" script to re-compile. Likewise, the maximum "block"
size for the data structure used throughout WARP3D
is "mxvl" (usually 64 or 128).

The "main" program for WARP3D is in the file "main_program.f".

2. BUILD/COMPILE PROCESS  ** Important **

Precompiled executables are included for Windows (64-bit),
64-bit Linux (Intel), and Mac OS X). For other systems, or to
re-compile the code for any reason, follow the instructions below.

Linux and OS X:

The compile and link process to create a WARP3D executable is performed using
"makefiles" and the "make" program on Linux & OS X. We provide an interactive
shell script, "Makewarp.bash", which guides you through the process of 
selecting options to include and then building the code via makefiles. 

We strongly urge you to use ONLY this approach to build WARP3D - it is 
very simple and easy! At a shell command prompt, say %, just enter 
the command "Makewarp.bash".

Windows:

The compile and link process to create a WARP3D executable on Windows is 
performed using a makefile and the "nmake" utility included in 
Windows. nmake is installed as a prerequisite to the Intel Fortran 
Compiler, so if you are planning on re-compiling the code, you already 
have it installed.

We provide a batch script, "Makewarp.bat", which sets up the proper directories
and solvers and builds the code via an nmake file. 

We urge you to use ONLY this approach to build WARP3D on Windows - it is
very simple and easy! Within the command prompt environment that the 
Intel Fortran Compiler creates (in the "start" menu), just "cd" to 
the WARP3D "src" directory and enter the command ".\Makewarp.bat".

Using the individual makefiles without proper knowledge can 
lead to errors in the compiling process. Makefiles for the various 
platforms and versions (omp, mpi_omp) are all named
Makefile.xxx.
